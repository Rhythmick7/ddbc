            <h3>Update for Club Members - 1st August 2024</h3>
            <p>Following the committee meeting of 1st August, please note the following update from Alan Kitson, Chairman.</p>
            
            <h4>Annual Fun Day</h4>
            <p>
                We’ve had to change the date for the Club Fun day. 
                It will be held on the morning of Thursday 5 September. 
                It was a very enjoyable experience last year and should be even better this year. 
                It would be good to see you there. Stand by for further details.
            </p>

            <h4>Finals Day</h4>
            <p>
                Finals Day for the club competitions will be on Thursday 29 th August. 
                It will be organised on similar lines to last year’s and will be equally as enjoyable. 
                Again, stand by for further details.
            </p>

            <h4>Round Robins Survey</h4>
            <p>
                27 members responded to Andy Wilson’s survey. Thank you to each of you.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was general support for a further Round Robin and the overwhelming preference was for Thursday morning.
                So starting Thursday 8th August there will be a Round Robin on Thursdays. Be there at 9.30 for a 9.45 kick off.
            </p>
            <p>
                The popularity of Round Robins is very encouraging and all members of the Club are equally entitled to take part. 
                If there are more than 20 members present for a Round Robin, it is necessary for some to sit out a round. 
                We would ask members to consider sharing a letter or volunteering to sit out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the survey feedback, other ways of administering social bowling will be reviewed and evaluated for the start of next season.
            </p>

            <h4>Two New Committee Members</h4>
            <p>
                I’m very pleased that the Committee co-opted Kevin Fletcher and Jaquie Taylor, both of whom volunteered to join. 
                This brings our number up to 8.
            </p>

            <h4>Team Membership</h4>
            <p>
                I understand that some new members may be interested in joining a team. 
                If any member is interested in joining a team please get in touch with me. 
                We are always looking for new team members and you would be very welcome.
            </p>

            <h3>The Bowlathon</h3>
            <p>
                Peter Hanson describes himself as a “massive rugby league fan” and “a great admirer” of Rob Burrow. 
                However, it was when a friend’s family member was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease that he decided to do something about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, with his wife Ann and a bunch of friends, he launched an appeal for funds for MND.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is a member of Denby Dale Bowling Club and he said he would bowl for 7 hours in one day. 
                He called it the Bowlathon. He set up a Just Giving page with a target of £500. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bowlathon took place last Saturday at Denby Dale Bowling Club. Friends, family members, 
                members of the bowling club and passers by came along to support him. 
                Some even bowled along side him for short spells.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weather was dreadful. It rained. Then it poured and then it poured some more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peter kept going and in the end he achieved his goal of completing the Bowlathon.
            </p>
            <p>
                He also raised over £2500 in total, including over £700 on the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day Peter thanked everyone for their support and went quietly home.
            </p>
            <p>
                A spokesman for Denby Dale Bowling Club said <q>the whole club is so proud of what
                Peter has done. It’s an incredible effort. He and his wife Ann plus their small group of
                helpers were an impressive team.</q>

                <p>Subject: Stand up to Cancer - Dog walking challenge</p>
                <p><q>
                    Me and my wife Claire are aiming to walk Leo our crazy cocker 
                    an average of 5 miles every day throughout April to help 
                    Stand Up To Cancer raise vital funds for cancer research. 
                    I’m sure Leo is up to the challenge, not too sure about me and Claire 
                    but we will definitely do our best. 
                    We will keep posting regular updates of our progress throughout April 
                    so we would be so grateful for your support and help fund

            <h3>Charity Bowlathon in aid of Motor Neurone Disease</h3>
            <p>
                On Saturday 15th June Peter Hanson will be bowling from 9am to 4pm in aid of Motor Neurone Disease.
                Please see Peter's Just Giving page below for further details.
            </p>
            <p>
                A brief introduction from Peter ...
            </p>
            <i>
                <p>
                    The MND Association focus on improving access to care, research and campaigning for those people living with or 
                    affected by MND in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an avid Rugby League supporter I have been thinking of raising money for MND for sometime because of Rob Burrow, 
                    though as a player he never did my team any favours. Also as a keen Crown Green Bowler, I found out earlier this year that my Team 
                    Captain's son Nik has been diagnosed with MND. This gave me the impetus to come up with the idea of a Bowlathon to try and raise as much money as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Saturday 15th June 2024 I will be bowling for 7 hours in honour of Rob Burrow's shirt number. 
                    I will be bowling from 9.00am at Denby Dale Bowling Club and I hope as many people as possible will come and bowl a few ends with me. 
                    Tea and coffee, cakes and buns will be available for a small donation. None bowlers are very welcome to come and watch and support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By sponsoring me your money will help people affected by Motor Neurone Disease. 
                    Once you donate, JustGiving will send your money directly to the MND Association. 
                    Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and secure, your details are safe - they'll never sell them or send unwanted emails.
